# rock-paper-scissors-classifier
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Rock-Paper-Scissors image classification using Python and PyTorch. Includes preprocessing, augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

## Objectives

- Explore and preprocess image data
- Implement convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch
- Use transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
- Compare model performance and analyze misclassifications
- Deploy the model using webcam input and perform fine-tuning
- Evaluate model performance before and after fine-tuning


## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn


## Notes

- All tasks are organized and clearly labeled in the notebook
- Markdown cells provide explanations and reflections throughout
- Webcam images and large files are excluded from the repository using `.gitignore`
